    "'''1 Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?'''\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions reduce the need for duplicate code and also it increases the reusability of code. \n",
    "This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update. and saves the programming time\n",
    "\n",
    "'''2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?'''\n",
    "\n",
    "code in a function run When a function is \"called\" the program \"leaves\" the current section of code and \n",
    "begins to execute the  first line inside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "'''3. What statement creates a function?'''\n",
    "\n",
    "The def keyword is followed by the function name with round brackets and a colon. creats a function\n",
    "\n",
    "ex; def add(a,b):\n",
    "    return a +b\n",
    "\n",
    "'''4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?'''\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a block of code that does a particular operation and returns a result. It usually accepts inputs \n",
    "as parameters and returns a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function call is the code used to pass control to a function. and call function by passing an arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "'''5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?'''\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use an unqualified name inside a function, Python searches three scopes—the local (L), then the global (G), and \n",
    "then the built-in (B)—and stops at the first place the name is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "there are foure local  scope in pythom: 1,local, 2,enclosing, 3,global, and 4,built-in.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    there is only one type of global python scope per programe\n",
    "    \n",
    "'''6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?'''\n",
    "\n",
    "When the execution of the function terminates (returns), the local variables are destroyed. Codelens helps you \n",
    "visualize this because the local variables disappear after the function returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?'''\n",
    "\n",
    "A return statement is used to end the execution of the function call and “returns” the result \n",
    "(value of the expression following the return keyword) to the caller. \n",
    "The statements after the return statements are not executed. \n",
    "If the return statement is without any expression, then the special value None is returned.\n",
    "yes its possible to return a value after expression\n",
    "\n",
    "'''8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?'''\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function does not have a return statement it will  return or undefined\n",
    "\n",
    "'''9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?'''\n",
    "\n",
    "function variable refer to global variable when it is defined before function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to refer to a global variable in a function, you can use the global keyword to declare \n",
    "which variables are global.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic rules for global keyword in Python are:\n",
    "When we create a variable inside a function, it is local by default.\n",
    "When we define a variable outside of a function, it is global by default.\n",
    "We use global keyword to read and write a global variable inside a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''10. What is the data type of None?'''\n",
    "data type of none is : NoneType\n",
    "\n",
    "The None keyword is used to define a null value, or no value at all. None is not the same as 0, False, or an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "None is a data type of its own (NoneType) and only None can be None.\n",
    "\n",
    "'''11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?'''\n",
    "\n",
    "it import a module named areallyourpetsnamederic but \n",
    "its not an python module question\n",
    "\n",
    "'''12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?'''\n",
    "\n",
    "spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "'''13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?'''\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Exception handling and Method and try and except statement To save our programme from crashing\n",
    "\n",
    "When it encounters an error, the control is passed to the except block, skipping the code in between. As seen in the above code,\n",
    "we have moved our code inside a try and except statement. Try running the program and it should throw an error message instead of\n",
    "crashing the program\n",
    "\n",
    "'''14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?'''\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Try:\n",
    "    The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Except:\n",
    "    The except block lets you handle the error.\n",
